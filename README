## Overview
This project is a Node.js + Express backend module for a behavioural assessment system.
Users submit answers to an assessment, the system scores those answers, runs basic reliability checks, and generates safe share and compare payloads without exposing raw responses.

## Data Model
An assessment is modeled as a set of questions mapped to behavioural dimensions (for example, communication or problem-solving).
Each user submission contains a list of answers with numeric values.
All data is stored in memory to keep the scope focused on business logic rather than persistence, as required for this exercise.

## Scoring Logic
User answers are grouped by their associated dimension.
Each dimension score is calculated as the average of the valid answers mapped to it.
Missing or out-of-range values are ignored or flagged to prevent invalid scores from affecting the result.

## Reliability Checks
The system runs simple heuristic checks to determine whether a response is usable:
- Identical answers check: flags responses where all answers have the same value.
- Extreme answers check: flags responses with too many minimum or maximum values.
- Skipped items check: flags responses where too many questions are unanswered.
Each check produces a pass/fail result, and an overall usability status is derived from them.

## Share Payload
The share payload contains only high-level dimension scores and summary labels.
Raw answers, question-level data, and internal reliability flags are intentionally excluded.
This ensures the payload is safe to share publicly and does not leak sensitive information.

## Compare Payload
The compare payload highlights similarities and differences between two users at the dimension level.
Only aggregated scores and relative comparisons are included.
No raw answers or internal metadata are exposed, keeping the comparison safe and privacy-preserving.

## Error Handling
The application uses centralized error-handling middleware to return consistent and meaningful error responses for invalid input and edge cases.

## API Testing
All public APIs were tested using Postman, including negative scenarios.
A Postman collection is included in the repository for easy verification.

## How to Run
Install dependencies and start the server:

npm install  
npm start  

Alternatively:
node index.js
